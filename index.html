								<p>
									I’m Samuel Swanson, a data engineer with a strong background in software development, data analysis, and spatial statistics. 
									I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a Minor in Statistics and Geography, and a Certificate in GIS. 
									Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in several programming languages including Python, TypeScript, Java, and JavaScript, 
									and have worked extensively with frameworks like Angular and Docker.

									In my current role as an Associate Data Engineer at Optum, I lead the design and development of web applications to streamline
									 processes and enhance efficiency. I specialize in API development and have delivered impactful results, such as saving $300k 
									 annually by replacing legacy SSIS batch processes with REST and SOAP APIs. Before moving into data engineering, 
									 I worked as a Spatial Statistics Researcher, where I applied advanced statistical methods to analyze issues like the Flint water crisis.
									
									I’m passionate about using data to solve complex problems, and I enjoy mentoring and collaborating with teams to create innovative solutions. 
									My goal is to continue leveraging my technical skills to drive improvements and efficiencies across industries.

								<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
								<h4>Informaswan Website</h4>
								<p>
									This is a personal website project I’ve been developing in my spare time. 
									While still in the early stages of development, the site is designed to offer a visually-driven experience for users. 
									I believe that visualization is a powerful tool often underutilized on websites, and my goal is to incorporate unique, 
									visually engaging elements throughout the site to present information in a more intuitive and compelling way.

								<h2>Computer Science Projects</h2>
								<h4 class="major">Game of Tag</h4>
								<p>
									In this project, I developed a game utilizing core Java concepts such as objects, 
									interfaces, nested classes, and exception handling, as well as multi-threading to manage concurrent actions. 
									I leveraged data structures like HashMaps, ArrayLists, and Strings, and utilized Java's Scanner class for user input. 
									The game's objective was to have the player chase and tag a computer-controlled character, which moved randomly around the board. 
									The computer would strategically place traps as it moved, and the player won once they successfully tagged the computer. 
									This project required careful implementation of game logic, threading, and efficient data management to ensure smooth gameplay.

								<h4 class="major">Computer Graphics</h4>
								<p>
									This was a collaborative project in which my partner and I implemented perspective and parallel projection techniques, 
									as well as clipping algorithms for 3D graphics rendering. We also developed various 3D shapes, 
									including spheres, cubes, houses, cones, and cylinders. The project presented significant challenges, 
									particularly with the complex matrix and vector mathematics involved, as well as the conversion from 3D to 2D space for display. 
									Below are screenshots of the final implementation, along with a link to the GitHub repository.

								<h2>Geography Project</h2>
								<h4 class="major">Nature Deficit Disorder</h4>
								<p>
									Urbanization has significantly transformed the world, largely for the better. It has fostered creativity, 
									with large urban centers becoming key drivers of economic growth. These urbanized areas have such a strong 
									pull that they attract a growing number of people. However, one of the challenges of urbanization is the 
									increase in noise pollution and the diminished exposure to natural environments.
									
									Living in densely populated urban areas, where noise levels are high, can lead to a range of negative health 
									effects, including elevated blood pressure, increased risk of stroke, and heart disease. These health issues 
									often stem from higher levels of stress, which can lead to poor lifestyle choices such as overeating and 
									excessive alcohol consumption. This knowledge underscores the importance of addressing these concerns in urban planning.
									
									Cities have begun to take proactive steps to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization. Initiatives such 
									as promoting electric vehicles, designing buildings with noise-reducing features, and introducing "pleasant" 
									noise to mask disruptive sounds are gaining traction. Ultimately, where we live has a profound effect on our well-being, 
									and urban planners must focus on creating environments that reduce stress and promote health.
									
									This project aims to identify areas within the Twin Cities with the highest concentrations of natural spaces, 
									as well as those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of urbanization, in order to guide future urban planning efforts.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project is an integral part of my capstone, aligning with my minor in Geography and Certificate in GIS. 
									It demonstrates critical thinking skills developed through my Computer Science studies, while also offering a 
									unique analysis of important real-world issues. Additionally, GIS relies heavily on techniques from Computer Graphics, 
									creating a strong connection to the previous project I completed. Furthermore, the underlying software development 
									for GIS is rooted in Computer Science, making this project a natural fit for inclusion in my portfolio.
